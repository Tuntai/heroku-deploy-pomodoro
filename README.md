## What's next for Pomodoro? :thinking:
- Developing a better model where every user can have their own personalized services.
- We want to add more options for different types of meditations.
- Maybe we can try creating a mobile application to make it more accessible for every type of user.
- We want to create a customizable playlist so that the user can choose a track while meditating according to their mood!
